## The Internet of Things

<blockquote>
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices,
vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"),
buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors,
actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect
and exchange data.

Basically, nowdays people are connecting toasters to cloud services just because
they can.

It nonetheless an interesting idea with many potential useful and revolutionary
applications.

???
Basically, people are connecting everything with a micro controller to the
internet just because they can.

Well, that's it for the boring part.

## The Arduino Platform

- Open source software & hardware
- Cross-platform: runs and builds on Win / Mac / Linux
- Arduino Programming Language (C++ subset)
- Lots of barriers to entry caused by hardware requirements are removed or made easier
- - Arduino IDE - all the tools you need in one
- - - Being open source, it's widely supported by many third party platforms
- - A single integrated hardware device idealized for prototyping
- Suitable for all levels of expertise

???

- Open Source
- Cross-platform
- Its basically C with some ++ features
- Its easy!
- - You can use an external editor, of course...
- - Includes a multitude of i/o options and the use of its components facility is very very simplified
- - - Have you ever flashed a device without integrated flashing facilities?
- - - Expansibility with shields, ....

@TODO: talk about fritzing and
Circuit design - diagrams - export as EVERYTHING - order an etched PCB online

But...

we're actually not using an arduino today.

ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜§

Let's take a look at one amazing little product

---

## The ESP8266

It lacks a marketable image and an identity, like the arduino has.

But like the arduino, it exists in many, many forms.

## The ESP8266

The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi chip with full TCP/IP stack and MCU capability
produced by Shanghai-based Chinese manufacturer, Espressif Systems.

It's basically an "almost-arduino" with internet.

Most forms lack the removed barriers to entry mentioned before. There's
no integrating flashing circuit.

It came with a somewhat primitive firmware that accepted
[Hayes commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set)
that allowed it to connect to wifi networks, act as an access point, as well as
making TCP connections and acting as a TCP server.

Gladly, its cheap price and light form meant that the internet would become
very interested in it.

???

Most forms like the ones displayed on the images above.

Show the ESP01 around, and some of the extra components you need to flash it.

You could use this firmware to communicate via serial i/o with a real arduino,
like this: https://github.com/ticklemynausea/ArduinoNano_ESP8266_DHT11-Sensor_NokiaLCD

The internet developed other firmware ecosystems that run in it, based on
popular programming languages like javascript and python.

## Meet the NodeMCU

NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the
ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems and hardware which is based on the
ESP-12 module. The firmware uses the Lua scripting language.

<div class="center">
  <img src="/images/devboard+esp8266.jpg" width="500" />
</div>

.center.font-xs[And his uncle the ESP01]

Physical characteristics: 80/160 MHz, 128kB memory, 4MB flash size

Oh, and we can use the Arduino IDE to flash Arduino Skeches on the
devkit.

Basically, it can be used just like an arduino ðŸ˜¦ ðŸ˜§ ðŸ˜®

???

Go ahead, you can touch it.

The name "NodeMCU" refers to the firmware. The boards you have there are actually
called the "NodeMCU devkit". Let's just call them NodeMCUs. Or devkits.

Today you get to do C++ instead of Javascript. Aren't you lucky?

When you first flash an Arduino Sketch on the devkit, you're erasing the NodeMCU
firmware. Fortunately, you can get it on the internet and use many tools to
flash it back. You could also try and flash other projects' firmware like
Mongoose IoT and micropython. Don't do it now please!

@TODO write some facts about how small 128kb is

wtf do you mean, used just like an arduino
???
let's see!

## Arduino Boards

Varying sizes, shapes and features.

## Arduino Features

### An integrated development environment

Allows you to write and upload a sketch in seconds.

### A bunch of digital general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins

They can perform as both input and output. You set their role programatically.

### Analog input pins

Not all arduino boards have these. Our NodeMCU devkit doesn't either, but don't
worry, we're not going to do any analog circuits today.

???

Let's backtrack a bit to the arduino to see some characteristics of these
devkits that we also have in the nodemcu devkit.

## Arduino &mdash; Sketch organization

The entry point for your application is an `.ino` file.

The IDE imposes that this file must be named the same as its parent folder.

Support files need to be at the same level as your `.ino` file for `#import`
macros to work properly.

```shell
project
â”œâ”€â”€ project.ino
â”œâ”€â”€ wifi.h
â”œâ”€â”€ wifi.cpp
â””â”€â”€ ...
```
---

## Arduino &mdash; Sketch code skeleton

```c
#define LED 5

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once
  //
  // used for setting up pin modes, serial monitor,
  // and one-time initialization functions

  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  Serial.println("LED is on");
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);

  Serial.println("LED is off");
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
```

???
An arduino sketch consists basically of a setup function, which runs once
on startup, and a loop function, which runs repeatedly.

In ths loop, you could write code that, for example, checked for an input,
acted on that input, and paused for a bit.

Or don't check for inputs at all like the example code does.

---

## Important functions

### I/O

```c
// mode = INPUT | OUTPUT
void pinMode(int pin, int mode)

// returns HIGH | LOW (1 | 0)
int digitalRead(int pin)

// value should be HIGH | LOW (1 | 0)
void digitalWrite(int pin, int value)

// value should be between 0-255 or 0-1023; uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
// this function has nothing to do with analog pins or analog circuits -
// PWM is a digital circuits' thing
void analogWrite(int pin, int value)
```

???

analogWrite has a bad name :(

---

## Important functions

### Timing

```c
int millis()

int micros()

void delay(int millis)

void delayMicroseconds(int micros)
```
